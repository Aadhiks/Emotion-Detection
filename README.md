# Emotion-Detection

📌 Overview

Emotion recognition is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction. This project uses deep learning techniques to classify human emotions based on facial expressions.

🚀 Features

Facial Expression Recognition: Detects emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Multiple Emotion Categories: Recognizes emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

Real-Time Detection: Supports live video feed analysis.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface for users.

🛠️ Tech Stack
